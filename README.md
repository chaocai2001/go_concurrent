# go_concurrent
The package is to simplify the concurrent programming. As you known, coordinating the multi goroutings is always complicated, even for some normal cases.
Now, you can leverage the functions in the package to implement the following typical cases easily and quickly.
1. Wait util all tasks complete
2. Wait util any task complete

You can focus on implementing the logic of tasks without caring about the complex concurrent programming.
